## ToDo

* Enumerable Mapping collection (possibly namespace) -- Maybe
  MappingPool, but the TextMapper module is probably enough to start
* Parse feature with DocString and Table
* Multiple dispatch
* Debug Mapping wrapper to trace execution
* Read input from STDIN
* Demonstrate conversion of HTML (microgherkin) or Markdown into test case
* Cucumber stepdef compatibility DSL

## Done
